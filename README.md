# IGI-Research-Data
IGI-Research-Data üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è is a repository that contains all the research information for [Project I.G.I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_I.G.I.) game for educational purposes.

## Data - Section
### `Data` section contains all the data that were used for Game Level/A.I/3D-Objects/Graphs etc.
- `Data/AI` - Contains data scripts regarding A.I behaviors and Actions used in the level like `level/AI/503.qvm`.
- `Data/Graphs` - Contains data regarding Graphs of the game like `Areas` information and Graph _Nodes, Vertices, Material_ information stored. It also contains some graphs converted to [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) format.
- `Data/Misc` - The Misc section contains information about Game variables/constants used in the IGI Game engine, and a fully advanced [Cheat-Engine Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheat_Engine) üïπÔ∏è _PROJECT-IGI-1.CT_ which has data for Player/A.I/Vehicles/Game State/Profile and more.

## Research - Section
### `Research` section contains all the research that was done on game files/memory using _Runtime_ or _Static_ analysis methods.
- `Research/GRAPH` - Contains all the information about Graph structure, nodes/vertices/signature with detailed analysis, including _Russian translation_ for notes. üìàüîç
- `Research/MEF` - Contains a file explaining the structure of MEF. üìÇ
- `Research/QVM` - Contains a file explaining the structure of QVM. üß©
- `Research/QSC` - Contains a file explaining the structure of QSC _Q-Scripts_. These files were decompiled using *Python* üêç tool. üìú
- `Research/Natives` - File contains Natives now as `Source Code` in `Assembly/C++` format as well used for `Project IGI 1`. All natives methods were decompiled using the original game `igi.exe` using **IDA/Ghidra** for educational purposes, not intending any harm to game files and their property. üìù
- `Research/Models` - File `IGI-Models.json` contains a list of almost 600 different building/object model information, including `MEF` data. This data was extracted using `Debug-Mode` used by developers in testing, which can be unlocked using this script [IGI-Debug-Mode](https://gist.github.com/haseeb-heaven/721d82fccc8de3e6da95cfa609230cea). üèóÔ∏è

## Tools - Section
### `Tools` section contains all the custom tools that were built for Project IGI 1/2 during research. üõ†Ô∏è

| TGaConv              | Texture converter for objects (e.g., wood_material.tex, concrete_bullet.tex) to convert to PNG format | Jones-HM |

## Templates - Section
### `Templates` section contains templates for [010 Editor](https://www.sweetscape.com/010editor/) for both IGI1 and IGI2 game.

## Data Disclaimer
This data is for educational purposes to learn how the game reacts with [Game Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_engine) and to understand game mechanics behind `QVM` Virtual machine and all its stuff. Please don't use this data to make `cheats/hacks` for this game, as this data was originally used by Game developers to develop the game. So, respect the developers and don't ruin any data posted here.

Some data were decompiled using the original game `igi.exe` using [IDA](https://hex-rays.com/ida-pro/)/[Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) for educational purposes, not intending any harm to game files and their property.
