ðŸ“‚ **Resource Converter Instructions**

**Compile (Turning Files into Resources):**
1. **Prepare Files:** Start by placing the files you want to convert into the **input** folder. These should include files with the ".qsc" extension and any other necessary files.

2. **Run Compilation:** Next, open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder containing your conversion files, and execute the following command:
   
   compile.bat
   
   This command will trigger the compilation process.

3. **Check Output:** Once the process is complete, check the **output** folder. You'll find the converted resource files there.

**Decompile (Turning Resources into Files):**
1. **Prepare Resources:** Place the resource files with the ".res" extension, along with any other required files, into the **input** folder.

2. **Run Decompilation:** Open your terminal or command prompt, go to the folder with your resources, and execute the following command:
   
   decompile.bat
   
   This command initiates the decompilation process.

3. **Check Output:** After the process finishes, look in the **output** folder. You will find the decompiled files there.

These step-by-step instructions should help you effectively use the resource converter for both compilation and decompilation.
